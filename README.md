# Data Engineering Project: End-to-End Data Pipeline with Power BI Analysis
 
This project demonstrates a complete data engineering workflow involving **data ingestion**, **data transformation**, **incremental loading**, and **Power BI analysis**. It is designed to simulate a real-world data pipeline that prepares data for business intelligence reporting.
 
##  Project Overview
 
The objective of this project is to build a robust and scalable data pipeline that:
 
- Ingests raw data from various sources

- Transforms and cleans the data for analytics

- Implements incremental load to update the data warehouse efficiently

- Provides meaningful insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard

##  Technologies Used
 
- Python / SQL – For scripting and transformation logic

- Pandas / PySpark – For data wrangling and transformation

- SQL Server / PostgreSQL  – (Optional) as a data warehouse

- Power BI – For data visualization and reporting
